Changelog for package bebop_driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.6.0 (2016-11-02)
------------------
* Use Parrot ARSDK as a thirdparty dependency
  - Instead of building the SDK inline, bebop_driver now utilizes the
  catkin version of Parrot ARSDK available at
  https://github.com/AutonomyLab/parrot_arsdk and in a binary form via the
  ROS buildfarm: ros-<DISTRO>-parrot-arsdk
* Rename liblibbebop to libbebop
* Full SDK 3.10.x support
  - ROS API change: states/ARDrone3/.. topics renamed to states/ardrone3/..
*  Disabling video stabilization works with Firmware 3.9 (tested on Bebop
  2)
* Camera control API fix for SDK 3.10.x
* Refactor H264 decode class to support dynamic picture size
  - Add support for determining picture size from the stream
  - Add dynamic buffer re-allocation on picture size change
* Use av_frame_alloc() instead of the depr. avcodec_alloc_frame()
* Fix inconsistent SDK 3.10.1 key values
* Update autogenerated msgs/headers/docs to SDK 3.10.1
* CMake: fix dynamic reconfigure dependency bug
* Rename topic 'navigate_home' to 'autoflight/navigate_home'
* Add autonomous flight plans
* Contributors: Jacob Perron, Mani Monajjemi

0.5.1 (2016-05-04)
------------------
* Add bebop_description as a build dep to bebop_driver (fixes `#45 <https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy/issues/45>`_)
* Fix inline build of arsdk to use the frozen manifest (fixes `#46 <https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy/issues/46>`_)
  - Prior to this release, the build script would always compile the
  development branch of ARSDK. This fix ensures that instead of
  `default.xml` manifest file - which represents the dev version of ARSDK
  package - `release.xml` is used by `repo`. This manifest file includes a
  certain hash for each ARSDK package that enforces a consistent build for
  ARSDK.
