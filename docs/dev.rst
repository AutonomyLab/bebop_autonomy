Enabling Bebop In The Loop Tests
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd /path/to/bebop_ws
  $ catkin clean --cmake-cache
  $ catkin build bebop_driver --cmake-args -DRUN_HARDWARE_TESTS=ON

Running Bebop In The Loop Tests
-------------------------------

.. warning:: Bebop in the loop tests perform live unit tests with a real robot. Please proceed with caution and execute the tests in an area with at least 5 meters of clearance radius (empty space) around the Bebop.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd /path/to/bebop_ws/build/bebop_driver
  $ make tests
  $ rostest --text bebop_driver bebop_itl_test.test

Upgrading the Bebop SDK
=======================

1. Update the ``GIT_TAG`` of ``ARDroneSDK3`` in ``bebop_driver/CMakeLists.txt::add_custom_target::./repo init ... -b GIT_TAG`` to your desired commit hash, branch or tag (release). The official upstream repository is hosted `here <https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/arsdk_manifests>`_.
2. Checkout (or browse) the upstream repository at the same hash used in step (1) and open ``release.xml`` file. From this file, extract the commit hash of ``libARCommands`` from the ``revision`` property of this XML tag: ``<project name="libARCommands" ... revision="" />``.
3. Open ``bebop_driver/scripts/meta/generate.py`` and update ``LIBARCOMMANDS_GIT_HASH`` variable to the hash obtained in step (2).
4. Change the working diretory to ``bebop_driver/scripts/meta``, then execute ``generate.py`` from the command line. This will regenerate all automatically generated message definitions, header files and documentations.
5. Copy the generated files to their target locations by calling ``install.sh``.
6. In ``bebop_driver/include/bebop_driver/autogenerated/ardrone3_setting_callbacks.h`` change ``ARCONTROLLER_DICTIONARY_KEY_ARDRONE3_PILOTINGSETTINGSSTATE_MAXDISTANCECHANGED_VALUE`` to ``ARCONTROLLER_DICTIONARY_KEY_ARDRONE3_PILOTINGSETTINGSSTATE_MAXDISTANCECHANGED_CURRENT``. This is due to a bug in upstream XML definitions.
7. Remove ``build`` and ``devel`` space of your ``catkin`` workspace, then re-build it.
